## Getting Started

1. Turn on ("Up on, Down off.") each of the two halves using the small toggle beside the USB-C port. 
2. The keyboard should appear in bluetooth settings as "Cygnus". Connect to it to pair your computer with the keyboard. 
   Alternatively, connect a USB-C cable between the left half and your computer.
4. Type!

A starting [keymap](https://github.com/twalker/zmk-config-cygnus463/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#l0-base) has been flashed onto the keyboard. This keymap is just a starting point--it can be remapped to your preference and comfort.

# Hardware

#### Batteries

* Batteries need to be charged every 3 weeks or so, depending on usage. The percentage is reported to host computer.

#### Reset buttons

- Reset: 1 press
- Bootloader: 2 rapid presses
- Pairing: Long press, then release both halves simultaneously while not connected with USB. If this does not work, first flash both halves with [reset firmware](./precompiled-firmware/settings_reset-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2), then follow the [Reset Split Keyboard Procedure](https://zmk.dev/docs/troubleshooting/connection-issues#reset-split-keyboard-procedure).

## Hardware details

* Hot swappable MX switch sockets  
  The key switches can be changed without any desoldering. 
* Gateron Oil King v2 key switches
* MT3 Keycaps. 
  The keycaps can be be replaced with any other MX compatible keycaps--a keycap/switch pulling tool is needed.
* [Dactyl Cynus v1.0 4x6x3](https://github.com/juhakaup/keyboards/tree/main/Cygnus%20v1.0) designed by juhakaup.
* [Keyboard firmware source for ZMK](https://github.com/twalker/zmk-config-cygnus463)
* Batteries: 3.7v 110MAH LIPO. Batteries can be replaced with larger capacity 3.7v LIPO batteries for longer battery life, up to 500MAH.

The keyboard is high profile.

## Firmware

### To change the keymap with the online editor
1. Go to [this keymap editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) and authorize access to this repository. 
2. Select this repository and edit the keymap using the UI
3. Save the changes to the repository
4. Follow steps 4-6 above of downloading the workflow artifact, and flashing to each half of the keyboard.

### To change the keymap manually
1. Editing the `config/cygnus.keymap` file
2. Pushing changes to a topic branch (or main)
3. Open a pull request with the changes
4. Download the artifact generated by the Github workflow.
5. One half at a time, plug the half into USB, place into bootloader mode by double pressing the reset button.
6. Copy the `uf2` file for intended half (left or right) to the RP-2 USB drive that appears for the microcontroller when in bootloader mode.


### Firmware resources
* [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) open source firmware
* [Fork this repository](https://github.com/twalker/zmk-config-cygnus463/tree/main) -- a repository that's been created to configure or reconfigure your keyboard.
* The [Online Visual Keymap editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) provides a nice UI to edit keymaps and will open PRs against your zmk config repository.
* [List of Keycodes](https://zmk.dev/docs/keymaps/list-of-keycodes)
* This repository was initially forked from [juhakaup/zmk-cygnus-4x6](https://github.com/juhakaup/zmk-cygnus-4x6), and has been updated with an improved keymap.

## Training sites

* [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) to learn key positions and reduce errors with adaptive machine learning.
* [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) to practice prose, symbols, and numbers (extremely configurable -- check the **funbox**).
* [typing.io](https://typing.io/) to practice coding.
